# Migrations: the process rule

**Never edit a migration that has been merged. Add a new forward migration.**

`supabase/migrations/NNNN_name.sql` is applied once per database, by hand or by
the Supabase GitHub integration, and then recorded as applied. Editing the file
afterwards changes nothing in a database that already ran it, but it does change
what a fresh database gets, so the two drift apart. The next migration, whose
guard names something only the edited text creates, then fails on production.

That is exactly what happened with 0103: commit `001a2971` edited
`0064_notifications.sql` after 0064 was live (adding `notification_emit_org_role`,
the admin-only `storyboard_ready` audience, and the per-organization
`credits_low` key). 0103's guard required `notification_emit_org_role`, so it
failed on the live database with `0103 needs the notifications ...`.
0103 now carries those three deltas itself (section 0, `create or replace`).

## What to do instead

- Need to change something an earlier migration made? Write `NNNN+1`, with
  `create or replace`, `add column if not exists`, drop-then-create for
  constraints and triggers, so it is safe on both an old and a fresh database.
- A guard (`to_regprocedure(...) is null` / `to_regclass(...) is null`) may name
  only what an earlier migration created in its **first merged form**, or what
  the same file creates before the guard.
- A typo or comment fix in a merged migration is still an edit: do not.

## How it is enforced

`tests/test_migration_prerequisites.py` (part of `python3 -m unittest discover tests`)
checks every such guard in migrations numbered 0100 and up: the object must be
created in the same file before the guard, or by an earlier migration (or
`schema.sql` / `tests/security/bootstrap.sql`) and, using git history, already
in that migration's first merged version. Guards written `is not null` are
optional features and are not checked. The CI test job checks out full history
for this.

The `rls` job (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) additionally applies every
migration to a fresh PostgreSQL 16 in order. It cannot see drift by itself,
because a fresh database always has the edited text; to test an upgrade path,
apply the old version of the earlier migration
(`git show <sha>:supabase/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`) and then the new one.
