# Migrations: the process rule

**Never edit a migration that has been merged. Add a new forward migration.**

`supabase/migrations/NNNN_name.sql` is applied once per database, by hand or by
the Supabase GitHub integration, and then recorded as applied. Editing the file
afterwards changes nothing in a database that already ran it, but it does change
what a fresh database gets, so the two drift apart. The next migration, whose
guard names something only the edited text creates, then fails on production.

That is exactly what happened with 0103: commit `001a2971` edited
`0064_notifications.sql` after 0064 was live (adding `notification_emit_org_role`,
the admin-only `storyboard_ready` audience, and the per-organization
`credits_low` key). 0103's guard required `notification_emit_org_role`, so it
failed on the live database with `0103 needs the notifications ...`.
0103 now carries those three deltas itself (section 0, `create or replace`).

## What to do instead

- Need to change something an earlier migration made? Write `NNNN+1`, with
  `create or replace`, `add column if not exists`, drop-then-create for
  constraints and triggers, so it is safe on both an old and a fresh database.
- A guard (`to_regprocedure(...) is null` / `to_regclass(...) is null`) may name
  only what an earlier migration created in its **first merged form**, or what
  the same file creates before the guard.
- A typo or comment fix in a merged migration is still an edit: do not.

## How it is enforced

`tests/test_migration_prerequisites.py` (part of `python3 -m unittest discover tests`)
checks every such guard in migrations numbered 0100 and up: the object must be
created in the same file before the guard, or by an earlier migration (or
`schema.sql` / `tests/security/bootstrap.sql`) and, using git history, already
in that migration's first merged version. Guards written `is not null` are
optional features and are not checked. The CI test job checks out full history
for this.

The `rls` job (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) additionally applies every
migration to a fresh PostgreSQL 16 in order. It cannot see drift by itself,
because a fresh database always has the edited text; to test an upgrade path,
apply the old version of the earlier migration
(`git show <sha>:supabase/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`) and then the new one.

## Migrations that ship dormant (0107)

Some migrations are written to change nothing until a later change turns them on. 0107
(`0107_owner_safety.sql`: the database half of the admin second factor, audited owner actions, the
security trail) is the model: new tables and functions only, every switch off by default, no existing
policy, grant, trigger or function touched except the audit action list, which only gained names.
`tests/test_owner_safety_migration.py` fails if that ever stops being true.

- **Is it off?** `select admin_aal2_required from public.owner_security_settings;` must read `false`
  until the owner enrols two authenticators and switches it on (`docs/security/ADMIN_MFA.md`).
- **Is it working?** The verify block at the bottom of the file, and `select kind, at from
  public.security_events order by id desc limit 20;` (the three logging triggers fill it from any
  write to `app_members`, `credit_prices` or the settings row).
- **Undo.** The flag is the undo for behaviour. To remove the objects: `docs/sql/rollback_0107_owner_safety.sql`
  (owner-applied; the lab applies it to a scratch database and then re-applies 0107).
- **Replay.** The seed is `on conflict do nothing`, so re-running the file keeps whatever the owner set.
  Re-running 0093 or 0087 afterwards would put the old audit list back and the owner functions would
  start to fail loudly at their audit write (never silently): re-apply 0107 after it.
