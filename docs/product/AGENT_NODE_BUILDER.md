# Nightshift Agent → Node Builder, Phase 1

## Purpose
Build Nightshift-owned, auditable creative workflows: Brand Kit → Catalog → prompts → original image/video/vector model adapter → human review → export. Krea Nodes is a **benchmark**, not a provider integration.

## Implemented in this PR
- Zod v4 strict, versioned `AgentWorkflow` data contract, bounded to 64 nodes / 128 edges.
- Allowlisted registry of declarative node types. No arbitrary shell/script execution.
- Unique node IDs, edge validation, duplicate-edge checks, topological ordering and cycle detection.
- Fail-closed review gate for `asset.export`: every incoming path must traverse `review.approval`.
- Reject inline `apiKey`, `providerKey` and `endpoint` in creative nodes.
- Deterministic example ad campaign workflow.
- Unit tests for valid graphs, cycles, unknown types, review bypass, duplicate and missing links, inline secrets.

**This is NOT a workflow executor, AI agent, model API adapter or visual editor.** It makes zero network/provider calls, debits no credits, writes no tenant data and cannot publish/deploy.

## Next milestones
1. Typed node input/output contracts and authenticated, tenant-owned workflow storage with RLS.
2. Visual canvas editing, undo/versioning, workflow compilation preview, accessible keyboard operations.
3. Server-side validation of every node config; encrypted managed credential references, never client-supplied secrets.
4. Agent converts natural-language intent to schema-limited draft graphs with bounded cost estimates; user approves plan.
5. Asynchronous workers, per-node idempotency, timeouts, credits reserve/settle, immutable billing and failure recovery.
6. Direct-provider adapters: Ideogram Vector official API; BytePlus ModelArk Seedance (model/version/region/retirement/contract), license and redistribution review first.
7. Test with actual Supabase RLS, tenant isolation, safe credentials and publish gate OFF. No public posting without approval.

## Security note
Review node in a graph is only a structural rule. Runtime must validate **real authenticated human approval** and authorized asset ownership; the mere presence of a review node never counts as actual user approval. Model provider terms and pricing must be verified immediately before enabling paid usage.
