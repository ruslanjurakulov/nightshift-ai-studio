# Editor render fields (timeline document v1) — for the editor UI

Running list of every optional field the export engine understands beyond the
original document, with limits and defaults. Written for whoever builds the
editor controls. Every field is OPTIONAL: a document without it renders
exactly as it did before. Python (`modules/timeline.py`) and TypeScript
(`command-center/lib/editor.ts`, `lib/server/editor-guard.ts`) validate the
same limits; `schemas/timeline.schema.json` is the machine-readable twin.
The database function `editor_doc_problem` only checks `asset_id` values (at
any depth) and size, so it accepts all of these without a migration — and it
means a new field must never carry a media id under a name other than
`asset_id`.

Preview vs export: the export (ffmpeg) is the truth. Where the browser cannot
match it, the UI should say the preview is approximate (like the existing
note for text looks).

## Status

| # | Branch | Fields | State |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `claude/render-xfade-more` | `transition.style` (23 more names) | PR open |

## 1. Blend styles (`transition.style`, crossfade only)

Closed list, `XFADE_STYLES` in `lib/editor.ts` (this order is the picker order).
`fade` is the default and is never stored. Anything not on the list is refused
(no free text reaches ffmpeg).

Old 14: fade, dissolve, fadeblack, fadewhite, wipeleft, wiperight, slideleft,
slideright, slideup, slidedown, circleopen, circleclose, radial, zoomin.

New 23: wipeup, wipedown, smoothleft, smoothright, smoothup, smoothdown,
vertopen, vertclose, horzopen, horzclose, diagtl, diagtr, diagbl, diagbr,
wipetl, wipetr, wipebl, wipebr, squeezeh, squeezev, pixelize, hblur, distance.

Notes for glyphs/labels: the names follow ffmpeg, not intuition. Measured on
the real export (see `test_the_new_styles_draw_the_side_their_name_says`):
`diagtl` and `wipetl` bring the incoming picture in from the BOTTOM RIGHT;
`wipeup` brings it from the bottom; `smoothleft` is a soft edge moving
left to right; `vertopen` opens a column in the middle; `squeezeh` leaves the
old picture in a shrinking horizontal band. `pixelize`, `hblur` and
`distance` look like a plain mix on flat colours — only textures show them.
Duration limits are unchanged (0.2–2 s). The picker already lists every name
(glyph + en/ru/uz label added with this change); the UI builder may regroup.
